        <p>This page looks much cleaner now that i've put content in a div with a white background.</p>
        <p>Because this div is special, it has it's own id, "content".<br>This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.</p>
        <hr style="color: grey;">
        <p>This is a normal paragraph, except<span class="blue"> this span of text is blue</span><span class="fancy"> and this span has a font-family of cursive</span> because they belongs to two class called "blue" and "fancy" respectively.</p>
        <p>On the other hand,<span class="blue fancy"> this span text is both blue and fancy!</span></p>
        </div>
        <p>This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.</p>
