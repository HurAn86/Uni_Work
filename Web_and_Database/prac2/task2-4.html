    <h1>Fancy (and super-interesting) background</h1>
    <p>This page uses multiple images to create a seemingly random background that's very quick to load.</p>
    <p>The background color is ghostwhite, and the image file is tiled 3 times on itself at sifferent sizes.<br>(i've chosen 97px, 67px and 37px)</p>
